<p>In the desire to keep the number of fellowship high, many churches have willfully blinded religious people by preaching about sowing seeds and prosperity gospel. In reality, the churches have made it harder than ever to help people see Christianity, by tempting them to sacrifice eternal life with present and short-lived benefit of prosperity.</p>
<p>In a New testament, John tell a story of Nicodemus—a leader and member of Jewish religion, who came to speak to Jesus. Jesus told Nicodemus that there is only one way to enter God’s kingdom and that is a person has to be born again. Nicodemus account clearly show how religion blinded him and couldn’t even understand the meaning of <em>born again</em>. Jesus was not talking about the birth of our physical bodies. He was talking about the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the verses that followed, the sheer difficulty of Nicodemus in understanding Jesus had happened aptly reflected the endemic nature of the problem—religion makes people cling on their religion practise. The failure of Nicodemus to understand the Holy Spirit shocked Jesus and in awe He told Nicodemus “You are a great Jewish teacher. But you do not understand these things!.—John 3:10”. This is an excellent illustration that show the religion belief and practises hindered people from knowing the truth.</p>
<p>The Jews were playing their religious game very well every Sunday. There wasn’t anything especially stressful, dangerous, or complex about the practices of the God ’chosen people. In the teaching of Jesus Christ, the difficulties inherent in the religion become pronounced and even disastrous!. They had pieces of the puzzle. It’s like the blind man and the elephant. They are all touching a piece of it, but they don’t know what the big picture is.” Fear of change from our religion, or conflict to those we used to pray together help us to remain blind to Christianity and our belief so far is very easy to ignore it day after day.</p>
<p>Serious discipline of Jesus such as Paul argue that religion makes people as if they are close to the Lord Jesus, but the truth is that it drift people away from Him. Citing Isaiah, Mathew argues that religion inhibits people’s relationships and faith with God, the higher order criteria on which Christian must depend. You may think that knowing religion doesn’t make us close to God may not stop us wanting it. But you will be astonished that people want and are proud of religion, why? There is a very good reason for that: because it makes people feel better!</p>
<p>The ability of religion to motivate people and make them feel better is the chief reason as why many churches to day have escaped preaching sin and repentance, and instead preach prosperity feel good. Just like one author put it, like cigarettes and chocolate, religion will never make people absolutely happy because what they want are not confined to what’s good for them.</p>
<p>Jesus’s job on earth was to put people right with God. This involves to expose people with the true religion. This meant, inevitably, spending most time pouring over people and teach them to be right with God, love justice, walk humbly with God. But for Jesus, the greatest challenge didn’t lie in the people. It lay in the religion, the culture, and their incentives. He was shocked when He found pharisee and teachers were so driven by earnings that they couldn’t, and wouldn’t, see the impact that the religion culture had on individual morality or on the behavior of the wider society. When he shared his insights with the religious leader, Jesus was vindicated and was later crucified.</p>
<p>Look at the churches today, what you see is primarily inspirational speaking—the teaching is about feel better and wealth. However, anyone whose eyes are not blinded by money, power, and pride, who really look carefully, know there is something wrong: that religion that is based almost solely on good deeds, which is based on robbing God with prayers and sacrifice, which is based on obligations to the church or congregation , can only ultimately lead these people away from God. But sadly, no one in the church wants or feels able to speak up for fear of stepping out of line with the rest of the lemmings who were busy with material thing.</p>
<p>This problem is not new, it even existed in early churches. Paul in the book of Romans spoke about this problem. He clearly stated that religion and it’s practices as two of the chief causes of the failure in Christianity. Like the Jewish leader, today religious leaders and teachers refuse to recognize that their view points and religion model they are so proud is chiefly at fault, and they are entirely dismissive of the idea that the church had failed due to wrong belief. The Pharisee thought, What went wrong in their religion?, They concluded that the problem was caused by new philosophy brought by Jesus: and to continue with their religion model, He had to die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Plot to Kill Jesus Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”—John 11:45-48</p>
