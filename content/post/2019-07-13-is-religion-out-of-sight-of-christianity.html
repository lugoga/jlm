<p>In the desire to keep the number of fellowship high, many churches have willfully blinded religious people by preaching about sowing seedsa nd prosperity gospal. In reality, the churches have made it harder than ever to help people see Christianity, by tempting them to sacrife eternal life with present and short-lived benefit of prosperity.</p>
<p>In a New testament, John tell a story of a pharesee nicodemus. His account clearly show how religion blinds him and could not even understand the meaning of born again. In the verses that followed the teaching, the sheer difficulty in understanding Jesus had happened aptly reflected the endemic nature of the problem: the jews cling on their religion practses and even Jesus discipline declared that His teaching were difficult for jews to absorb.</p>
<p>The jews were playing their religious game very well every sunday . There wasn’t anything especially stressful, dangerous, or complex about the practices of the God ’chosen people . In the teaching of Jesus christ , however, the difficulties inherent in the religion become pronounced and even fatal.</p>
<p>They had pieces of the puzzle. It’s like the blind man and the elephant. They are all touching a piece of it, but they don’t know what the big picture is.”</p>
<p>Fear of change from our religion, or conflict to those we used to pray together help us to remain blind to Christianity and our belief so far is very easy to ignore it day after day.</p>
<p>Serious discipline of Jesus such as Paul argue that religious makr us as if we are close to the Lord Jesus, but the truth is that it drift us away from Him. Citing Isaiah Mathew argues that religion inhibits close relationships and faith , the kind of higherorder criteria on which Christian depend. The problem is that knowing that religion doesn’t make us close to God may not stop us wanting it. We want religion for a very good reason: it makes us feel better.</p>
<p>Religion does motivate us and it does make us feel better. That’s why churches preach prosperity. It may not, in and of itself, make us absolutely happy—but, just like cigarettes and chocolate, our wants are not confined to what’s good for us.</p>
<p>Jesus’s job on earth was to put mankind right with God. This involves to look for all aspects within the Jews nation processes and procedures, as well as within its religion , that exposed it to risks. This meant, inevitably, spending a great deal of time poring over people and teach them to be right with God, walk humbly with God. But for Jesus, the greatest exposure didn’t lie in the people. It lay in the religion, the culture, and their incentives.</p>
<p>He came to see that the Lord’s management—and He was shocked when He found the CEO and his executive teams (pharesee and teachers) —were so driven by earnings that they couldn’t, and wouldn’t, see the impact that the religion culture had on individual morality or on the behavior of the wider society. When he shared his insights with the religious leader, Jesus was fired. He was later vindicated and crucified.</p>
<p>Anyone whose eyes were not blinded by money, power, and pride, who really looked carefully, knew there was something wrong: that religion that is based almost solely on good deeds, which is based on robbing God with prayers and sacrifice , which is based on obligations to the church or congregation , could only ultimately lead to people away from God. But sadly, no one in the church wants or feels able to speak up for fear of stepping out of line with the rest of the lemmings who were busy witj sadaka and tenth.</p>
<p>This problem is not new, it even existed in early churches. Paul in the book of Romans spoke about this and clearly stated that religion and lts life practices as two of the chief causes of the failure in Christianity. These most religious leaders and teachers didn’t think they had to change their view points and religion model they were so proud was chiefly at fault, and they were entirely dismissive of the idea that the church had failed due to wrong belief. What went wrong, they thought, was the the man called Jesus: and to continue with their religion model, He has to die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Plot to Kill Jesus Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”—John 11:45-48</p>
