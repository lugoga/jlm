We have been brought up to believe that one need to be tied in one or the other denomination to become a charistian. However, its astonishing when you read the bible and find how Jesus challenge the idea. **Jesus** argued that religion never brought  people to God; in fact, religion was used as a mirror of the coming Jesus (Heb 10:1). Therefore, when Jesus came, sticking on *religion* undermined their moral motivation. Jesus again ana again showed that religion has no place in the kingdom of God. Jesus told the Nicodemus, a member of the Sanhedrin---a group of 70 jewish leaders that the religion rituals and practises they have kept for years will never help them to enter Gods'Kingdom of God, unless they are born again with water and spirit [*John 3:3*].

The Jesus's teaching caused a sensation to the Jews because it dared to challenge two fundamental tenets of their religion. First, that individuals get right with God by faith and not through good deeds and second, that God works always even in sabbath---a sacred day.But one may wonder why did the Jewish  religion  never mixed with Jesus teachings. What went wrong? Judaism came through  Laws  given to Moses for the children of Israel in a very sacred and special covenant at Mount Sinai and recorded for us in the book of Exodus. In this covenant, God wrote His laws on tablets of stone, and Israel was commanded to be obedient to all that was revealed to them. But this wonderful covenant was only a shadow of better covenant that God would one day give to His people, both Jew and Gentile. This new covenant is recorded for us in Jeremiah;

> *“The time is coming, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,” declares the Lord. “This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”---Jeremiah 31:31-34*

Christian prophecy was indeed fulfilled in the Jewish Messiah. Jesus came to the <u>lost sheep of the House of Israel </u> 2000 years ago. He came as Isaiah prophesized  to <u>suffer and die</u> for the sins of people [*Isa 53*]. He came to the nation of Israel, but was rejected. If the Jews would have accepted His "once for all" [*Heb. 10:10*] atonement for sins, Jesus would have ushered in the Kingdom of Heaven at that point in history. But the Jews did not recognize Him, even though they had the Word of God in their own Hebrew Scriptures, and more than 300 descriptions of who He would be when He comes. It was a tragedy, they had missed Him! Christians should not follow Judaism today because the Mosaic covenant has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Jesus said, *“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them”---Matthew 5:17*. And the writer to the Hebrews wrote, *“By calling this covenant ‘new,’ he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear”---Heb. 8:13*.

I think it is very important for Christians to know that the old covenant has been replaced. We now have a better covenant, with a better sacrifice, administered by a better High Priest! “Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful---*Heb. 10:19-23*.
