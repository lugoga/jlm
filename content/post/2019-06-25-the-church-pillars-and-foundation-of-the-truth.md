How you view the church will determine how you view the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God is seen in and through the church. The church is what Jesus is building to bring forth the Kingdom of God upon the earth.

When you believe the church is the manifestation of Godâ€™s Kingdom upon the earth and seek to build it you will reap the rewards of a blessed life now and in the age to come.
